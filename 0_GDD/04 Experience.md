You can gain experience in Relic Hunter in a variety of ways, with experience mostly serving as a soft gating mechanism allowing the player too feel a sense of growth and agency.

Activities that may grant experience points are
 - Defeating monsters
 - Disabling Traps
 - Solving Puzzles
 - Reaching POI's
 - Acquiring treasure and relics
 - Rare consumable items
   
   


Once the player has gained enough experience to level up, they will automatically gain a level, this grants the player an attribute point to spend in either Health, Stamina, Mana, Attack Power or Spell Power.

Gaining a level in a specified attribute generally grants a small flat bonus, and certain level milestones can grant traits, passive buffs, skills or stat increases to primary resource stats such as BonusMaximum, RegenAmount, RegenSpeed.

**Experience**

Players gain experience points (XP) by engaging in the core pillars of Relic Hunter's gameplay:
