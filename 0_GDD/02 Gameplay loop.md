Players navigate a hub-based world using their airship. 

They discover locations, interact with villages, and gather information about relic sites. 

Each challenging location offers traps, unique enemies, and the chance to discover valuable treasures and potent relics. 

Returning to their airship hub allows for trading, upgrading gear, and strategic preparation using their dynamic skill and trait system.
