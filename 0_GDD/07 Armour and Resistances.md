**Resistances Overview**

Relic Hunter features a robust resistance system influencing how players interact with incoming damage and environmental hazards. Resistances are divided into two primary categories:

**Physical Resistances**

- **Mitigation:** Armor primarily reduces physical damage. This provides a higher baseline reduction than elemental resistances.
- **Importance:** Physical damage is a consistent threat throughout the game, found in traps, enemy attacks, and environmental hazards across various areas.
- **Healing Limits:** No amount of resistance allows players to heal from physical damage sources.

**Elemental Resistances**

- **Sources:** Elemental resistances are gained through a variety of means, including equipment, traits, skills, buffs, and consumables.
- **Damage Reduction:** Like physical resistances, these mitigate incoming elemental damage of the corresponding type (fire, ice, etc.).
- **Status Resistance:** Elemental resistances also slow the buildup of related status effects. For example, fire resistance reduces the rate at which a burning effect accumulates.
- **Immunity and Beyond:** In certain cases, players can attain complete immunity to a specific damage type. Specialized traits and attribute-dependent skills can even surpass immunity, allowing the player to heal from that damage type instead.

**Key Points**

- **Diverse Sources:** Resistances are dynamic, influenced by many aspects of a character build.
- **Strategic Choices:** Players must balance physical versus elemental resistances based on the challenges they anticipate facing.
- **Beyond Defense:** The resistance system ties into status effect buildup and the potential for unique healing interactions, encouraging build experimentation.
  
  
**Resistances (Physical)**
The player can gain resistance to varying damage types depending on Items, equipment, traits, skills and buffs the player has available, in certain cases its possible for the player to become entirely immune to a certain damage type. 


There are certain damage types that armor cannot block and you can never heal from physical damage types with any amount of resistance.


Overall armour provides a higher base mitigation amount compared to elemental resistances, but physical damage will be a common occourence throughout the game, where as each area may be themed to a specific elemental damage type, all of them will almost always have traps and dangers that deal physical damage making it more globally applicable stat.





**Resistances (Elemental** 
The player can gain resistance to varying damage types depending on Items, equipment, traits, skills and buffs the player has available, in certain cases its possible for the player to become entirely immune to a certain damage type. 


Resistance stats also affect status build up, if a status is classified with an Element and the player has resistance to that element, they will also build up statuses of that type more slowly.

Once reaching natural immunity to a certain damage type, specific traits and attribute skills allow the player to surpass this limit and start healing in small amounts from the damage instead of taking damage themselves.
