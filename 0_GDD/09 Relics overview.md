**Relic System**

Relics in Relic Hunter possess a wide range of power and influence. They vary from seemingly mundane objects that reveal surprising abilities under the right conditions to legendary artifacts capable of fundamentally reshaping a character's approach to a challenge. Players may stumble upon a well-worn ring granting minor fire resistance or uncover the legendary Ember Blade, a weapon that ignites foes but demands a portion of the wielder's stamina with each strike.


There are three types of relics you can acquire, Equipment, Passive Relics (eg items you keep with you) and consumable relics (eg the trait and skill granting fruits.)

- **Rarity and Power:** Relics embody a spectrum of power and utility, ranging from minor enhancements to gameplay-altering artifacts.
- **Discovery as Reward:** Relics are uncovered through exploration, overcoming challenges, and delving into the forgotten past.
- **Storied Origins:** Each relic possesses a unique name, flavorful description, and hints of its history. These descriptions may even provide clues to unlocking their hidden potential.
- **Skill Sources and Interactions:** Relics grant a wide array of skills and abilities, often manipulating resources in unexpected ways and promoting the Artificer playstyle.
- **The Price of Power:** Some of the most potent relics come with drawbacks or tradeoffs, requiring careful consideration and influencing player choices.
- 
 **Hidden Potential:** Even seemingly mundane items may hold surprising powers. Certain pieces of equipment react to the environment or specific conditions, unlocking new skills or unexpected effects.
