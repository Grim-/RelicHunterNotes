Relic Hunter embraces a sense of discovery and rewards exploration. Skills and powerful relics are intertwined with the game world. Players uncover them through overcoming challenges, delving into forgotten ruins, and interacting with the environment.

- **Relic Power:** Relics are exceedingly rare treasures, often granting extraordinary skills or abilities, sometimes at a cost. The legendary Helmet of the Death Knight, for example, may allow the wearer to command the undead but comes with the risk of draining their life force.
- **Equipment as Skill Source:** Many special items and pieces of equipment grant unique skills. These range from powerful magical weapons to relic-like artifacts that manipulate resources in unexpected ways, allowing for the Artificer playstyle to flourish.

Skills can also be learnt from certain NPCs and special power imbuing fruits.
