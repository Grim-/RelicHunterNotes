 Game Overview:Â 
     
Relic hunter is a high fantasy, 'Gaslamp Fantasy' game set in a large world where magic is ever present, an every day facet of life, due to the range and varying nature of magic there are rather a lot of temples, old sites of power and other places to explore and plunder.**** 
     
It is a game of elemental and physical forces, interacting, weight based traps, trip wires, gas traps and various enemies.****
     
It is a large 'hub based' world (not open world). I consider the 'hub' to be the overworld of the map, this is where the player can explore, find the village, find the temple/relic/dungeon entrance (if its an internal one for example)****
     
The player based from their air ship which serves as their main base of operations, this is where they can store any items, equipment and treasure they have acquired, from this the player can using a map move the ship to different areas they have discovered or have been lead to (by story, npc etc) visiting the local villages and shops to trade, gathering information about the local temple/relic/site of power.****
	  
The player then has to overcome the traps, obstacles and enemys of the place, gaining treasure along the way (such items as gold bars, jewels, statues are generally considered valuable to vendors for gold not the player) and then 'relics' which are special pieces of equipment or consumables (such as the fruit that grants abilties and traits), gain xp and prepare for harder challenges.****
     
      
There is a large and varied skill and buff system to help the player accomplish this, further to that there are a number of 'traits' that various items, enemies and the player can attain, these traits range from simple stat boosts, to damage immunities, healing from certain damage types and even gaining, wings allowing the player to fly, horns to gore enemies and other such things





## Loop
The gameplay loop revolves around raiding temples in order to gain new items, loot and spells which help in the raiding of other tombs, there will be a small village intermission area where the player can buy/sell items and resources before setting out into another temple.


### Temple/Dungeon Types

- Classic - these levels are a little of everything, maybe a few combat encounters, traps and hidden secrets 
- Combat - these are levels that require more combat than exploring generally, these will also usually contain a boss, with the bosses mechanic being introduced throughout the dungeon itself.


## Other Gameplay Elements

### Combat
the player can avoid a lot of traps with a clever use of the games mechanics, but 

#### Elemental and Physical reactions
play a large part in the players problem solving in order to progress - imagine an power crystal on top of a large wooden platform with vines extending from the ground up to the wooden platform, you need this crystal in order to open a door further ahead but there are no visible ways up to it.

The player now has a problem that requires a solution ("I need that power crystal but currently have no way to reach it").

Solutions :  
1 : Burn the platform so the crystal drops down assuming you had a way to set it on fire from a range, either by spell, weapon or item.

2: Burn the vines themselves, which in turn will burn the platform.

3: Propel yourself up to the platform through Air spells, or other forces.

4: Fire yourself from a cannon

Which ever solution the player comes up with, its important they came up with it through the tools provided via spells, weapons and items, and bare in mind the Power Crystal itself may be another step in a problem/solution the user has.
