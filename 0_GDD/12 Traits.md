**Trait Overview**

Traits provide characters, enemies, and even environmental elements with specialized attributes and behaviors. These unique characteristics influence everything from combat resilience to puzzle-solving potential. 

Players acquire traits through leveling, overcoming special challenges, interacting with certain objects, or by equipping unique items. 

The dynamic interplay of traits creates surprising opportunities and challenges, encouraging players to adapt their tactics on the fly.


An example of a game play changing trait would the wings trait series of traits, mid-game the player will be introduced to powerful gameplay changing traits, the wings allow the player to expend stamina in order to be capable of flying, you have weight considerations when flying, where in reaching near the cap of your carry weight will severly limit your ability to fly, there are various graphical and tiers of wings mostly for player preference.


More mid tier traits include the ability to completely resist a certain damage type, this not only serves to create more focused builds but reaching the immunity cap is a key step in being able to heal from certain damage types.


Another mid tier series of traits serve to make certain scene objects for example a safe with a padlock on it immune to certain forms of damage, "Impervious : Blunt" serves the purpose of allowing the metal objects to resist blunt damage types and also display this to the player on the inspector UI for the current object. 

Certain skills will allow the player to borrow for a time a traits from objects in the scene, perhaps using this temporary trait to negate damage from a rock fall trap they have found up ahead.


Lower tier traits will cover utility and other simple stat buffs, and other traits such as an NPC having the 'Undead' trait causing them to heal from decay damage but take double divine damage.
