**Equipment Overview**

In Relic Hunter, equipment plays a pivotal role far beyond simple stat increases. It's a primary source of skill discovery, a key to unlocking unexpected strategies, and an essential tool for harnessing the unique power of relics. Specialized weaponry, like the seemingly harmless Leaf Fan that generates gusts of wind, or a spear imbued with the 'Throwable' trait, exemplify the unexpected potential of gear.

- **Skills and Resource Manipulation:** Specialized weaponry, tools, and even seemingly mundane items can grant potent new skills or alter the way resources like stamina and mana are consumed. This empowers the Artificer playstyle, allowing non-magical characters to wield extraordinary abilities fueled by their ingenuity and the right equipment.
    
- **Relic Augmentation:** Relics often reach their full potential when combined with complementary gear. A stamina-focused build may further enhance a relic that relies on physical exertion, while certain equipment pieces may reduce the drawbacks associated with particularly powerful relics.
    
- **Discovery and Utility:** Beyond combat and relics, equipment offers practical advantages. Tools for solving environmental puzzles, specialized armor granting access to hazardous areas, and even lockpicks for treasure chests all fall under this category, encouraging exploration and experimentation.
    
- **Rarity Tiers and Restrictions** Equipment adheres to a traditional rarity system, culminating in the extraordinary power of relics. Some relics might even be crafted through the combination of rare components. Certain pieces of equipment may have restrictions, requiring the wearer to have invested a threshold amount of levels into specific stats.
