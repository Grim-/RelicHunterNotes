**Primary Resources**

- **Health**
    
    - **Definition:** The fundamental resource representing a character's vitality and ability to endure physical harm. Health regenerates slowly over time.
    - **Sub-Stats:**
        - MaximumBonus: Determines the character's total health pool.
        - RegenerationAmount: The quantity of health recovered per interval.
        - RegenerationSpeed: The frequency of health recovery.
    - **Unique Mechanics:**
        - The burning condition disables natural health regeneration, creating immediate risk and necessitating healing items or abilities.
        - Certain schools of magic forego traditional mana, drawing upon their life force to power spells.
- **Stamina**
    
    - **Definition:** Governs physical exertion and fuels actions like melee attacks, dodging, and short-term abilities such as sprinting or flight. Stamina regenerates quickly, supporting bursts of activity followed by rest.

        - Fuels essential actions in both combat and environmental exploration (e.g., moving heavy obstacles).
- **Mana**
    
    - **Definition:** The traditional source of magical power, fueling spells and unique abilities. Mana offers immense potential but necessitates strategic use due to its slow replenishment.
    - **Sub-Stats:**
        - MaximumBonus: Determines the total mana pool, allowing for powerful spellcasting.
        - RegenerationAmount: Represents the small amount of mana restored per interval.
        - RegenerationSpeed: Dictates the rate of gradual mana recovery.
    - **Unique Mechanics**
        - Mages gain access to incredibly potent spells, offering solutions to a wide range of challenges when the proper tools (spells) are available.
        - Potential for high-risk spells that might incur temporary detriments alongside their powerful effects.
