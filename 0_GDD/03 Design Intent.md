Relic Hunter embraces emergent gameplay as a core design philosophy. Players are given a robust toolbox of skills, abilities, and environmental interactions with a focus on physicality. Systems are designed to interlock in meaningful and often unexpected ways. The goal is to reward player experimentation, encourage creative problem-solving, and foster a sense of discovery through actions that have logical, intuitive outcomes in the game's world.

It hopes to achieve this by providing, skills, traits and equipment capable of affecting change in the environment.

 Providing otherwise inaccessible strategies through traits like "Trait : Wings" or "Trait: Fireproof", traits exist for items, equipment and the player.
 
 Similarly certain equipment can grant those who are not magically inclined the same access to these systems through a series of equipment they would carry fulfilling certain tasks, such as a fire sword to burn/start fires, a musket loaded with cannons to provide explosive force, a cape that may enable levitation. 


- **Example Scenario:** A potent wind spell might not only push back foes but could also be used to trigger traps, propel objects, or even redirect a projectile.
- **Player Agency:** Players should feel like active participants in a reactive world. Their actions have consequences, opening up new possibilities beyond simply following a predetermined path.
- **"Aha!" Moments:** Designing puzzles and encounters that spark moments of clever improvisation and problem-solving is essential to the Relic Hunter experience.

 **Emergent Gameplay Focus:**

This resource system aims to promote player experimentation, problem-solving, and adaptation. Health, Stamina, and Mana each offer a distinct set of tools and limitations. These limitations encourage creative strategies and the exploitation of unexpected interactions between the various resources, skills, and the game's environment.
