The Airship (TBD) will serve as the players own personal space in the world of (no name yet), it will allow a degree of personalization through the placing of props and containers and other work benches.


From the airship the player can move to the deck of the air ship and interact with the wheel, doing so displays a world map, the world map will have sections on it, clicking a section will move to a local region map displaying each hub area available in that region, selecting by clicking a hub icon will ask the player to confirm if they wish to travel there. 
This will load the scene and place the player and the airship at a predetermined location, where the player can use one of the ships mechanisms to reach the ground.


The airship also serves as the place where the player may go and prepare for an outing, in hub world exploration the player may return to the airship at any time, however inside dungeons the player cannot return to their airship at will.



The player will be able to find, buy or craft props such as
- An alchemy table for crafting potions
- A wardrobe where the player set their load out of gear, such as equipment, weapons, shields, spell books.
- A lectern for modifying the spell list of your spell tome
- A work bench for crafting simple items and weapons - advanced gear will still have to be procured, also can be used to initiate the start of rebuilding a relic, though that will generally require visiting certain locations of power to actually forge.


**Airship and Hub System (Revised)**

**The Airship: Player Sanctuary and Operations Hub**

The airship serves as the player's home base throughout Relic Hunter, it is also a relic itself given to the player at the start.

 Here's a breakdown of its functions:

- **Personalization and Functionality:** Players customize their airship through props, storage containers, and specialized crafting stations. Examples of craftable/purchasable props include:
    
    - Alchemy Table (Potion Crafting)
    - Wardrobe (Equipment and Spell Loadout Management)
    - Lectern (Spell Tome Modification)
    - Workbench (Basic Crafting, Relic Restoration Initiation)
- **Navigation:** Interacting with the airship's wheel brings up a world map. This map is divided into regions, with each region containing clickable hub locations. Selecting a hub initiates travel, loading the appropriate hub scene and placing the airship at a designated landing spot.
    
- **Exploration Base:** The airship acts as a safe haven in hub-based areas, allowing players to return at any time to resupply, craft, or strategize. However, excursions into dungeons or specific challenge areas may temporarily restrict returning to the airship.
    
- **Narrative Progression:** Over time, the airship may gain enhancements tied to the player's story progress. Examples include power sources for reaching new regions or modifications allowing for exploration of harsher environments.
