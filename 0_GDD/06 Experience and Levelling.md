Players earn experience points (XP) through various actions that emphasize Relic Hunter's core gameplay pillars. This includes:

- **Combat:** Defeating challenging enemies rewards tactical play and resource management.
- **Exploration:** Discovering hidden relics and treasures encourages thorough exploration and seeking out secrets.
- **Problem-solving:** Successfully disarming traps and overcoming environmental puzzles rewards clever thinking and experimentation.



**Resource Progression Milestones**

**Revised Explanation**

Instead of traditional skill trees, progression in Relic Hunter works through a system of milestones within each primary resource (Health, Stamina, Mana). As players level up and invest points in a specific resource, they reach thresholds that unlock significant bonuses or unique skills. This encourages dedication to a playstyle while still allowing for flexibility in overall build.

**Stamina Progression Milestones - Example**

- Level 1: +10 Max Stamina
- Level 2: +10 Max Stamina 
- And so on..
- Level 10: +20 Max Stamina (Milestone Bonus)
- Level 11: +10 Max Stamina 
- Level 15: Unlock the "Double Jump" Skill (Milestone Reward)
- Level 30: All Stamina costs reduced by 20% (Milestone Reward)
- 
**Health Milestones**

- Level 10: Reduced duration of the 'Burning' effect and other common debuffs (poison, etc.). (Reactive survivability focus)
    
- Level 20: Gain stacks of a "Resilience" buff on taking damage. Each stack provides a small, temporary damage reduction against all sources. (Promotes strategic risk-taking)
    
- Level 30: "Second Wind": When reaching critical health, gain a burst of stamina and temporary movement speed. (Encourages desperate plays and narrow escapes)
    

**Additional Mana Ideas**

- Level 15: Unlocks "Mana Infusion" – Temporarily imbue a weapon with elemental damage based on the spell used for infusion. (Unique interaction, adds a layer to combat)
    
- Level 25: "Blink" – A very short-range teleport, consuming a significant chunk of mana. (Mobility tool with a strategic cost)
