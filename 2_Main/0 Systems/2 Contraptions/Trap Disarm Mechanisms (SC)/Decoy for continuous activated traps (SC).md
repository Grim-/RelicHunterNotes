- when that's an option - Some traps will be able to aim only one target at a time but will not have a way to disable them.

- Disarming Action - So instead of you trying to disable the trap (while its impossible) you can use enemies/objects to instead activate them and lock their targeting on them instead of you. (Depending the weight limit or the movement detectability of different traps they will require different type of enemies/objects.)

- Result - You can pass while the trap aims an other target.
