- when that's an option - That's where the twist of using fake traps starts becoming useful. Once the player is getting familiar with fake traps and stops paying attention to them, you can add some Make believe fake traps mixed together with the fakes. Those will work exactly like fake traps but instead they will actually activate at the last moment to apply lethal damage.

- Disarming Action - Test which traps are truly fake and which traps are make believe and instead move through the actual fake traps instead.

- Result - "You got double pranked bro!" (Here psychological trick pays off }:-) )
