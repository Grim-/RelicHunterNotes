- when that's an option - Some traps will be able to get blocked by a massive object. (Example 1: a wall that shoots arrows can get blocked by a big movable block that you can move together with you while you pass that trap, or by a huge shield. Example 2: you come across a corridor with a big row of spike traps, there is a stone block there that you can move so it gets on top of the trap rendering the spikes useless.)

- Disarming Action - So instead of you trying to disable the trap (while its impossible) you can use objects to instead block them. (Depending the weight/size/material of the object different traps they will require different type of objects.)

- Result - You can pass while the trap is blocked.
