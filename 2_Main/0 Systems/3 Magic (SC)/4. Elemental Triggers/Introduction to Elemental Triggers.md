- The basis of elemental triggers - Elemental triggers are any type of manifestation of an element, such triggers can either be found in the game's environment, or created by your enemies, or created by you via sigil summoning, or created by your equipment.

- Examples of Elemental Triggers
  1. Environmental Elemental Triggers: 
     There is a flaming torch/a fountain of water/an exposed electric wire (etc) and you cast a rune spell or an oil skill near it/on it, now that spell/action triggers an elemental spell/action instead.
  2. Elemental Triggers from enemies: 
     The enemy spellcaster shoot you with a fireball/aquawhip/thunderzap and you either dodged it or redirected the projectile resulting on it hitting the ground. The ground at the position that projectile landed has now "leftovers" of elemental energy that can be used once, you cast a rune spell or an oil skill near it/on it, now that spell/action triggers an elemental spell/action instead.
  3. Sigil Summoning Elemental Triggers: 
     That's the only purely direct way to apply elemental attributes to your rune spells/oil skills. Say you summon a Fire Sigil, now any rune spell/oil skill will activate fire effects instead.
  4. Equipment Elemental Triggers: 
     That's a less direct but still viable way to apply elemental attributes to your rune spells/oil skills. Say you carry a fire sword the gets imbued with fire after 5 hits. Once you activate that fire imbue, now any rune spell/oil skill will activate fire effects instead but will consume the imbue.

**Combine Basic Elemental Triggers to create Elemental Combinations** 

- The basis of elemental combinations - Elemental combinations are the new elements created by combining basic elemental manifestations together.

- Examples of Combining Basic Elemental Triggers
  1. Combining Environmental Elemental Triggers: 
     There is a flaming torch and 5 meters away there is a fountain of water, you move/throw that flaming torch to the fountain of water, they explode and now the fountain of water became a fountain of heat, now activating any rune spell or oil skill near it/on it triggers instead a heat element spell/action.
  2. Combining Basic Elemental Triggers from enemies: 
     The enemy spellcaster shoot you with a fireball but you dodged it , now he shoots you with an aquawhip but you redirect it using Rune of Redirection and aim it on the "leftovers" of fire energy that was created but the last fireball. The ground at the position that both projectile landed has now "leftovers" of Heat energy that was created by combining the fire projectiles leftover and water projectiles leftover and can be used once, you cast a rune spell or an oil skill near it/on it, now that spell/action triggers a Heat spell/action instead.
  3. Combining Sigil Summoning Elemental Triggers: 
     That's the only purely direct way to combine basic elements and apply new combined elemental attributes to your rune spells/oil skills. Say you summon a Fire Sigil and then a Water Sigil at the same spot, that is resulting in a Heat Sigil, now any rune spell/oil skill will activate Heat effects instead.
  4. Combining Equipment Elemental Triggers: 
     That's a less direct but still viable way to combine basic elements and apply new combined elemental attributes to your rune spells/oil skills. Say you carry a fire sword on your right hand the gets imbued with fire after 5 hits and a water dagger on your left hand that gets imbued with water after 3 hits. Once you activate both the fire imbue and the water imbue both weapons get imbued with Heat instead, now any rune spell/oil skill will activate Heat effects instead but will consume the imbue.
