## Damage Types
Weapons can deal a variety of Damage Types, including physical and magical/elemental.

## Weapon Scaling
All weapons have a strength scaling value and a magic scaling value. These values are used along with any other relevant buffs to calculate the final damage amount each weapon attack will deal. Each specific Attack Animation Set has its own physical and elemental multipliers.

## Weapon Abilities
Weapons will be capable of blocking, being used as the source of a spell, and in certain cases, they can come with an innate ability. Often, these weapons will override spell costs, allowing magic spells to be cast with stamina.

## Physical Weapons
- **Swords, Axes, Hammers, Spears**: Physical weapons with a variety of traits, damage types, and unique effects and visuals. They allow for the casting of spells otherwise unavailable to the player due to stats or not having the spell. For example, the granite hammer allows the player to channel a thunderstrike at a location while the key is held, something that otherwise requires a moderate magic level and access to mana.

## Magical Weapons
- **Wands**: A smaller one-handed version of a staff, providing the same benefits but generally smaller. They can also channel spells through them but cannot block.
- **Shields**: Blocking with a shield allows the player to block and consume stamina instead of taking damage. Each shield has a blocking factor determining what percentage of damage it can absorb, up to absorbing it all. Additionally, each shield has a stamina cost scale, ranging anywhere from 50% less stamina cost to 500% more.
- **Spell Tomes**: Spell tomes often contain a variety of spells that the player gains access to while the tome is equipped. Tomes, staves, and wands all offer a percentage bonus to magic power or the mana max/regen stats.
- **Staffs**: Staffs generally have a spell embedded in them that they can cast cheaper than the player could innately due to channeling through the staff. Some staffs are also capable of generating a magical barrier and preventing elemental damage.

## Ranged Weapons
- **Bows, Crossbows, Muskets, and Cannons**: These weapons all fire a variety of projectiles, most are limited to only being able to fire certain types (Arrow, ArrowLarge, SmallBore, LargeBore, Special).
   - **Bows**: Bows have a variable draw rate and fire power. Generally, bows are cheap to use and a good ranged option.
   - **Crossbows**: Armor-piercing power. Crossbows boast high damage per shot but have a lengthy reload time.
   - **Muskets**: Firepower at the cost of accuracy. Muskets deliver significant kinetic damage but have poor accuracy and even longer reloads than crossbows.
   - **Cannons**: Large, make the player very slow, very slow reload times, capable of firing a variety of large, specialized ammunition.





**One-Handed Melee**

- **Swords**
    
    - **Design Goal:** Balance and versatility. Swords should offer a mix of slashing and piercing damage, with decent speed and potential for critical hits.
    - **Scaling:** Moderate PhysicalScaling, variable Elemental/Arcane scaling.
- **Hammers**
    
    - **Design Goal:** High impact against armored targets. Hammers focus on bludgeoning damage, with some armor-piercing potential, but likely slower attack speed.
    - **Scaling:** High PhysicalScaling, variable Elemental/Arcane scaling.
- **Maces**
    
    - **Design Goal:** Similar to hammers, but trade raw armor-piercing for a chance to stun or inflict status effects with bludgeoning force.
    - **Scaling:** High PhysicalScaling, variable Elemental/Arcane scaling.

**Two-Handed Melee**

- **Axes:**
    
    - **Design Goal:** Devastating power. Axes boast the highest base damage potential of melee weapons but are the slowest to wield.
    - **Scaling:** Very high PhysicalScaling, variable Elemental/Arcane scaling.
- **Hammers:**
    
    - **Design Goal:** An even heavier focus on shattering armor, perhaps even temporarily reducing enemy defenses on hit.
    - **Scaling:** Very high PhysicalScaling, variable Elemental/Arcane scaling.
- **Swords:**
    
    - **Design Goal:** Cleaving strikes with some reach. Two-handed swords might offer a small range bonus and wider attack arcs.
    - **Scaling:** High PhysicalScaling, variable Elemental/Arcane scaling.
- **Spears:**
    
    - **Design Goal:** Reach and precision. Spears have the longest melee range and emphasize piercing damage with critical hit bonuses.
    - **Scaling:** High PhysicalScaling, variable Elemental/Arcane scaling.
- **Staffs:**
    
    - **Design Goal:** Magical support. Staffs enhance spells by a percentage and may have a minor melee component for flavor.
    - **Scaling:** Scaling does not directly impact staff damage output.

**Ranged**

- **Bows:**
    
    - **Design Goal:** Fast and precise. Bows prioritize rapid fire with accuracy bonuses, moderate piercing damage.
    - **Scaling:** High PhysicalScaling, variable Elemental/Arcane scaling.
- **Crossbows:**
    
    - **Design Goal:** Armor-piercing power. Crossbows boast high damage per shot but have a lengthy reload time.
    - **Scaling:** Extremely high PhysicalScaling, variable Elemental/Arcane scaling.
- **Muskets:**
    
    - **Design Goal:** Firepower at the cost of accuracy. Muskets deliver significant kinetic damage but have poor accuracy and even longer reloads than crossbows.
    - **Scaling:** High PhysicalScaling, variable Elemental/Arcane scaling.

**Magical**

- **Wands:**
    
    - **Design Goal:** Precise energy projection. Wands excel in focused elemental or arcane blasts.
    - **Scaling:** Scaling does not directly impact wand damage output.
- **Tomes:**
    
    - **Design Goal:** Spellcasting conduit and power boost. Tomes offer a passive boost to magical damage and a repository for learned spells.
    - **Scaling:** Scaling does not directly impact tome damage output.
