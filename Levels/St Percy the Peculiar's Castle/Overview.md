- Name: Sir Percival Peculiar-Panoply’s Castle Grounds

_The "Percival" part is a classic knight's name which feels at home in a fantasy setting. "Peculiar" suggests that he was a bit odd, which fits with the 'mad' part of your description. Lastly, "Panoply" is an old term for a complete suit of armor, but it also refers to a splendid array, fitting for someone who collected relics. This way, the name suggests something about the character's personality and his obsession_
