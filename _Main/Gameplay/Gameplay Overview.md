## Loop
The gameplay loop revolves around raiding temples in order to gain new items, loot and spells which help in the raiding of other tombs, there will be a small village intermission area where the player can buy/sell items and resources before setting out into another temple.


### Temple/Dungeon Types

- Classic - these levels are a little of everything, maybe a few combat encounters, traps and hidden secrets 
- Combat - these are levels that require more combat than exploring generally, these will also usually contain a boss, with the bosses mechanic being introduced throughout the dungeon itself.


## Other Gameplay Elements

### Combat
the player can avoid a lot of traps with a clever use of the games mechanics, but 

#### Elemental and Physical reactions
play a large part in the players problem solving in order to progress - imagine an power crystal on top of a large wooden platform with vines extending from the ground up to the wooden platform, you need this crystal in order to open a door further ahead but there are no visible ways up to it.

The player now has a problem that requires a solution ("I need that power crystal but currently have no way to reach it").

Solutions :  
1 : Burn the platform so the crystal drops down assuming you had a way to set it on fire from a range, either by spell, weapon or item.

2: Burn the vines themselves, which in turn will burn the platform.

3: Propel yourself up to the platform through Air spells, or other forces.

4: Fire yourself from a cannon

Which ever solution the player comes up with, its important they came up with it through the tools provided via spells, weapons and items, and bare in mind the Power Crystal itself may be another step in a problem/solution the user has.
