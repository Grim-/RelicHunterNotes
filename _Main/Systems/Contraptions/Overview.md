Contraption is the general name given to a trap, scene prop mechanic or object that is controlled by a series of mechanism, activators, motors and actuators in order to for example; trigger an arrow trap, or a floor spike sequence.


A Contraption is generally made up of atleast two things


A Trap Trigger 
The trap trigger is what will cause the trap to initially arm, it can be a stone you step on, a fire you light, a tripe wire etc.

A Trap 
This is the trap itself, it could be a boulder spawning trap, that rolls a boulder down a confined space. 
It could trigger fire grates that add the burning status build up and knock the player back.
It could enable a series of TrapGroupControllers to arm their grouped traps in a systemic way.
