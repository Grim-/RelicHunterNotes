- Position - It will usually be hanging from high elevations. (aka ceilings, horizontal pillars etc)

- Disarming Action - You will be required to aim and hit the rope with a ranged attack to cut it and release the weight.  (Depending the material of the rope it may require stronger attacks, for example a iron chain rope will require steel arrow? Or a stronger elemental projectile?)

- Result - The trap that is linked to that mechanism will be disabled.
