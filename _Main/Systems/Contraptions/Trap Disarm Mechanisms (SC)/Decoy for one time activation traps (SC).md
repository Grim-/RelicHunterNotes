- when that's an option - Some traps will be able to activate only one time but that one time will guaranty the death of the player.

- Disarming Action - So instead of you activating the trap and dying as a result you can use enemies/objects to instead activate them and waste their single time activation. (Depending the weight limit or the movement detectability of different traps they will require different type of enemies/objects.)

- Result - The single activation of the trap is done and the trap gets deactivated.
