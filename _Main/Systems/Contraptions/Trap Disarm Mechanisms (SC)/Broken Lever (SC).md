- Position - It will usually be positioned on the ground or on walls. (If a missing stick exists it may be placed somewhere hidden, or as a drop from an enemy, or as loot from a chest.)

- Disarming Action - You will be required to either find the missing piece or use an alternative item to place as stick to the lever and then interact with the action button to pull it. (Depending the type of the lever it may require different alternative sticks.)

- Result - The trap that is linked to that mechanism will be disabled.
