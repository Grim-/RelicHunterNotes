**Basic Attack System**

- Weapons have two primary types of attacks: 5 weak attacks and 3 strong attacks.
- These attacks can be combined to create combo attacks, providing a layer of strategy and player agency in combat situations.

**Elemental and Physical Damage Multipliers**

- Each combo attack, unique to each weapon, has specific multipliers for elemental and physical damage.
- These multipliers contribute to the overall effectiveness of the attack, depending on the enemy's weaknesses and resistances.

**Weapon Variety**

- Players can equip a wide variety of weapons.
- These include: 1H Swords, Shields, 1H Maces, 1H Throwing Weapons, Ranged Weapons, 2H Swords, 2H Maces, and 2H Polearms.

**Weapon Traits and Stat Bonuses**

- Weapons possess Traits, which grant special effects or capabilities to the weapon.
- An example Trait is "Charging (Physical/Elemental)": This trait siphons a portion of the dealt damage, storing it in the weapon. When maximum charge is reached, the weapon releases this energy in an explosive attack.
- Furthermore, each weapon provides stat bonuses to the player, including: Attack Power, Spell Power, Movement Speed, Armour, and the aforementioned Traits.

**Gadgets**

- The weapon system also incorporates "gadgets", such as grappling hooks and anchors.
- These items, while not strictly weapons, provide unique mechanics and can play a pivotal role in exploration and combat scenarios.
