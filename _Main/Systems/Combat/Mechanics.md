**Damage Multipliers**  
Each weapon has a damage multiplier for physical, elemental and backstab damage. This multiplier is per combo attack.

eg.

2H Sword Weak Attack 1 :  
1.5 Physical Damage  
0.8 Elemental Damage

**Back stab**  
Some weapons are capable of performing a backstab attack causing large amounts of physical damage when attacking a target from behind.

**Blocking**  
the player can block with certain weapons, some are better at mitigating damage than others but may take more stamina per damage blocked.  
Some weapons can block elemental damage. Holding some weapons up to block costs an initial amount of stamina.

**Dodging**  
The player can time a dodge perfectly so that they avoid all damage and regain some stamina, otherwise dodging is a means to avoid damage by simply getting out of range of it quicker than running. Dodging costs stamina.

**Perfect Blocking**  
Some weapons are capable of perfect blocking, when this occurs the enemy is stunned if they are able to be stunned, this can allow players to reposition for back stab damage (if that weapon is capable of causing backstab damage)
