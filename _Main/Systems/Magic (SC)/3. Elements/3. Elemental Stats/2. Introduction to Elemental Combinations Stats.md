- Elemental Combination Stats - Elemental stats for new elements that are results of elemental combinations will take into account the arithmetic mean of both basic elemental stats.

  - For Example:
    1. The Elemental Powers that will be taken into account when you cast an Electric Spell will be your Fire Power plus your Wind Power divided by 2. (If per say you have 42 Fire Power and Wind Power 34 you will do (42+34):2=38 , so your Electric Power is 38.)
    2. The Elemental Resistance that will be taken into account when you get hit by a Magma Spell will be your Fire Resistance plus your Earth Resistance divided by 2. (If per say you have 61 Fire Resistance and Earth Resistance 24 you will do (61+24):2=42,5 , so your Electric Power is 42,5.)
